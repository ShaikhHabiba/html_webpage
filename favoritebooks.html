            The C Programming Language is a computer programming book written by
            Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally
            designed and implemented the C programming language, as well as
            co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the
            language was closely intertwined. The book was central to the
            development and popularization of C and is still widely read and
            used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original
            language designer, and because the first edition of the book served
            for many years as the de facto standard for the language, the book
            was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on c. C was
            created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as an
            augmented version of Ken Thompson's B. Another Bell Labs employee,
            Brian Kernighan, had written the first C tutorialand he persuaded
            Ritchie to coauthor a book on the language. Kernighan would write
            most of the book's "expository" material, and Ritchie's reference
            manual became its appendices. The first edition, published February
            22, 1978, was the first widely available book on the C programming
            language.<br>
             Its version of C is sometimes termed K&R C (after the
            book's authors), often to distinguish this early version from the
            later version of C standardized as ANSI C.In April 1988, the second
            edition of the book was published, updated to cover the changes to
            the language resulting from the then-new ANSI C standard,
            particularly with the inclusion of reference material on standard
            libraries. The second edition of the book (and as of 2023, the most
            recent) has since been translated into over 20 languages. In 2012,
            an eBook version of the second edition was published in ePub, Mobi,
            and PDF formats. ANSI C, first standardized in 1989 (as ANSI
            X3.159-1989), has since undergone several revisions, the most recent
            of which is ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (also termed C17 or C18), adopted as
            an ANSI standard in June 2018. However, no new edition of The C
            Programming Language has been issued to cover the more recent
            standards.

            The reader-friendly Algorithm Design Manual provides straightforward
            access to combinatorial algorithms technology, stressing design over
            analysis. The first part, Techniques, provides accessible
            instruction on methods for designing and analyzing computer
            algorithms. The second part, Resources, is intended for browsing and
            reference, and comprises the catalog of algorithmic resources,
            implementations and an extensive bibliography.In mathematics and
            computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous
            instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems
            or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications
            for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced
            algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through
            various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce
            valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning), achieving
            automation eventually. Using human characteristics as descriptors of
            machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing
            with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus". <br>
            In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully
            specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results,
            especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct
            or optimal result.As an effective method, an algorithm can be
            expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a
            well-defined formal languagefor calculating a function. Starting
            from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),the
            instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds
            through a finite number of well-defined successive states,
            eventually producing "output"and terminating at a final ending
            state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily
            deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms,
            incorporate random input.

            The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) is a comprehensive monograph
            written by the computer scientist Donald Knuth presenting
            programming algorithms and their analysis. Volumes 1–5 are intended
            to represent the central core of computer programming for sequential
            machines. When Knuth began the project in 1962, he originally
            conceived of it as a single book with twelve chapters. The first
            three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set
            were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Work began in earnest on
            Volume 4 in 1973, but was suspended in 1977 for work on typesetting
            prompted by the second edition of Volume 2. Writing of the final
            copy of Volume 4A began in longhand in 2001, and the first online
            pre-fascicle, 2A, appeared later in 2001. The first published
            installment of Volume 4 appeared in paperback as Fascicle 2 in 2005.
            The hardback Volume 4A, combining Volume 4, Fascicles 0–4, was
            published in 2011. Volume 4, Fascicle 6 ("Satisfiability") was
            released in December 2015; Volume 4, Fascicle 5 ("Mathematical
            Preliminaries Redux; Backtracking; Dancing Links") was released in
            November 2019. Volume 4B consists of material evolved from Fascicles
            5 and 6.<br> 
            The manuscript was sent to the publisher on August 1, 2022,
            and the volume was published in September 2022. Fascicle 7, planned
            for Volume 4C, was the subject of Knuth's talk on August 3,
            2022.After winning a Westinghouse Talent Search scholarship, Knuth
            enrolled at the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western
            Reserve University), where his performance was so outstanding that
            the faculty voted to award him a master of science upon his
            completion of the bachelor's degree. During his summer vacations,
            Knuth was hired by the Burroughs Corporation to write compilers,
            earning more in his summer months than full professors did for an
            entire year.Such exploits made Knuth a topic of discussion among the
            mathematics department, which included Richard S. Varga. In January
            1962, when he was a graduate student in the mathematics department
            at Caltech, Knuth was approached by Addison-Wesley to write a book
            about compiler design, and he proposed a larger scope. He came up
            with a list of twelve chapter titles the same day. In the summer of
            1962 he worked on a FORTRAN compiler for UNIVAC. During this time,
            he also came up with a mathematical analysis of linear probing,
            which convinced him to present the material with a quantitative
            approach. After receiving his Ph.D. in June 1963, he began working
            on his manuscript, of which he finished his first draft in June
            1965, at 3000 hand-written pages. He had assumed that about five
            hand-written pages would translate into one printed page, but his
            publisher said instead that about 1+1⁄2 hand-written pages
            translated to one printed page. This meant he had approximately 2000
            printed pages of material, which closely matches the size of the
            first three published volumes.
