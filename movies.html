            Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was written by J. K. Rowling
            and is the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series. The
            book is about a seventeen-year-old wizard, named Harry Potter, who
            has to travel all over England to find things that will help him
            defeat the evil wizard, Lord Voldomort. The main theme/moral of the
            entire series is good will always triumphs over evil. In every book,
            even when it looks like evil is going to win, good always triumphs
            in the end.There are two sides in Harry Potter and the Deathly
            Hallows, the good side, and the bad. The main characters on the good
            side are Harry Potter and his two friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione
            Granger, and on the bad the main character is Lord Voldomort. Harry
            Potter is a courageous, brave, and kind person.<br> 
            The whole series
            revolves around Harry Potter and Lord Voldomort. Ron Weasley is
            Harry’s closest friend and is not always the brightest but he is a
            good person who always stands with Harry no matter the situation.
            Hermione Granger is a book worm, straight A student who turns every
            assignment in on time and always does whatever her teachers tell her
            to do, and because of her skill and knowledge she has helped the
            trio out of several tight situations. Lord Voldomort is the most
            evil of the evil. His goal is to rule the world, kill every muggle
            (non magical people) so that only wizards are left and, most
            importantly, to conquer death. Through out the entire series
            Voldomort has tried to kill Harry a total of eight times but has
            failed all because of his short-sightedness and un-willingness to
            admit to his weaknesses.
