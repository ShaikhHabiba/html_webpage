          <h2>COOKING</h2>
          <p>
            My Hobby Cooking. Cooking is my hobby and my passion. I have always
            loved being in the kitchen, experimenting with different ingredients
            and techniques to create delicious and satisfying meals. I find
            cooking to be therapeutic and relaxing, and it brings me a great
            sense of fulfillment and enjoyment. One of the reasons I love
            cooking is that it allows me to be creative and to experiment with
            different flavors and textures. I enjoy trying out new recipes and
            coming up with my own creations. I also love to try out different
            cuisines and to learn about the various cooking styles and
            ingredients from around the world. <br>
            Cooking gives me the freedom to be creative and to express myself through my food.
            In addition to the personal benefits of cooking, it is also beneficial for my
            health. Cooking at home allows me to control the ingredients and the
            cooking methods, which means I can make healthier choices. I can use
            fresh, whole ingredients, and I can avoid processed and unhealthy
            foods. Cooking at home also allows me to save money, as eating out
            can be expensive.

          <h2>READING BOOKS</h2>
          <p>
            Reading books is my favorite hobby. It gives me a chance to explore
            different worlds, learn new things and broaden my perspective.Books
            provide a wealth of knowledge and a window into other cultures and
            lifestyles. They help me to understand and appreciate the world
            around me.Each book I read takes me on a new adventure. It’s
            exciting to discover new characters, places, and stories. I think my
            hobby of reading books will be my lifetime habit and I will always
            take my books with me when I die. Reading has helped me a lot to
            gather my knowledge and make it more powerful. <br>
            It has also made my brain strong and active because we have to think a 
            lot while we read or write anything. The habit reading was cultivated 
            when I was a kid. I used to read lots of small story books then. 
            Now I like reading all kinds of books and articles that give me more
            information and knowledge. Apart from my school books I read magazines,
             story books, novels, mythological stories, newspapers and any 
             kind of material that I find interesting. Reading enables me to learn 
             about so many things. I learned about History, Science, Biology, 
             general awareness and other fascinating things.
